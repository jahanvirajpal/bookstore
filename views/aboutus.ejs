            <p class="pt-2" style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;"> Reading is considered as the most intelligent habit. 
            Reading is intelligent but it's also enriching, soothing, escapist, inspirational,
             transformative and a timeless journey. The habit of reading opens the door for 
             completely new universes which existed merely as tiny filaments in our dreams. 
             With the transformed approach, BookChor brings you these unimaginable filaments 
             of wonders to your doorsteps. We are a team of dedicated book enthusiasts creating
              a dream from 2015 and working to deliver the dream to every book lover in India. 
              Through our journey we have developed an app to make the book purchase easy. 
              We have held events all over the nation which witnessed a gathering of thousands 
              of book lovers. We sell new books, old and used books, rare and limited editions, 
              everything under a single platform. We also provide you with an opportunity to 
              sell us books instead of letting them rot at the bottom of your bookshelf, in 
              return for more books.</p></div>

<p>In 205, HappyBooks! embarked on a mission close to our heart – to revolutionize 
    the way we read books in India. We are amazed by the leaps we've made and the 
    community we have built. HappyBooks! is not just a company; it’s a revolution that 
    is happening to transform the mind and hearts of readers.<br><br>

    From our humble beginnings, we've become the first online platform in India 
    dedicated to the sale of used and second-hand books. Apart from selling books 
    online, our offline events have become vivid celebrations of the literary arts, 
    bringing readers together with authors to share their passion<br><br>
    
    Our vision at HappyBooks! is audacious yet simple – to ignite the love for reading 
    within the Indian youth. We aim to spark curiosity, making quality literature 
    accessible to all. Our vision extends beyond selling books; it's about making our
     country 'literally wise again.'<br><br>
    
    The core of our mission is affordability. We do not tolerate the idea of a book 
    enthusiast walking away from a book just because it was expensive. HappyBooks! strives 
    to make quality books affordable for everyone. The best knowledge must be affordable 
    to the last person and we are all set to achieve our mission. <br><br>
    
    As we continue this literary crusade, I invite you to join hands with the HappyBooks! 
    vision. Let's make India a nation that reads, learns, and grows together, one beautiful
     book at a time</p>
